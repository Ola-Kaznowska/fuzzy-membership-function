Fuzzy Membership Function Visualization – "Warm" Temperature


This Python program demonstrates how to define and visualize a **triangular fuzzy membership function** for the fuzzy concept of "warm" temperature. It uses NumPy for numerical operations and Matplotlib for plotting.

## 📌 What This Program Does

- Defines a **triangular fuzzy set** for the linguistic variable "warm".
- Calculates the degree of membership for temperatures from 0°C to 50°C.
- Highlights specific temperature points (10°C, 30°C, 40°C) on the plot.
- Displays a graph showing how "warmth" increases and decreases based on temperature.
